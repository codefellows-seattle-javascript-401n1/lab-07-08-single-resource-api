#Building a single-resource-api Router  

#What I learned?  
  *promises: getting comfortable with the syntax and the order of execution  
  *how to tie together the server, router object, route object, and registering the routes  
  *the value of abstracting simple repetitive tasks like err responses  
  *the value of adding additional properties to a req or res object so that the new property can be passed along and accessed by other methods  
  *getting the httpie commands right  
  *I re-aquainted myself with packet sniffers after a 10 year break.  By using wireshark packet sniffer I could quickly tell if my http requests sent by httpie were correctly formatted.

#What items do I still not understand or what gaps have I identified in my knowledge?  
  *I was really strong at using the browser debugging tool.  I am very weak at using debugging tools with node.
