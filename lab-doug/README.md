#Building a single-resource-api Router  

#What I learned in lab-07
*promises: getting comfortable with the basic syntax and the order of execution  
*how to tie together the server, router object, route object, and registering the routes  
*the value of abstracting simple repetitive tasks like err responses  
*the value of adding additional properties to a req or res object so that the new property can be passed along and accessed by other methods  
*getting the httpie commands right  
*reaquainted myself with packet sniffers after a 10 year break.  By using   wireshark packet sniffer I could quickly tell if my http requests sent by httpie   were correctly formatted.  
*learned the basics of Postman plug-in for chrome  
*I learned the purpose of done() as it relates to mocha and where to place the call to the function when you have a series of nested requests  
*learn some basics of testing with chai.

#What I learned in Lab-08
*For the first time, I could actually visualize the program before I started coding and determine what code needed to be modified to change the service to meet the objectives of lab-08.  Although I did not know the exact code that needed to be written, I understood it in general terms before I started coding.

#What items do I still not understand or what gaps have I identified in my knowledge?
*I was really strong at using the browser debugging tool.  I am very weak at using debugging tools with node.  
*how to automate test when you have dynamically generated items like UUID?  We did a work around in GET test that required nested requests.  Not sure if that is a good solution.  
*how do you list multiple files under your 'test' task?  
*need more work with mocha gulp-mocha and chai.  Tests are not running properly from gulp file
